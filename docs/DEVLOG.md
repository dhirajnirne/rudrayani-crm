# Development Log

Task-by-task record of what was built, why, and how to see it working.
Phases and task numbers refer to the approved implementation plan (which follows
`rudrayani-crm-build-brief.md`).

## 2026-07-05 — Phase 0: Environment bring-up

**Goal:** make the existing scaffold actually run end-to-end on this machine.

### Changes
- Installed **Docker Desktop 4.80** (was missing — the DB had nowhere to run).
- Initialized the **git repository** with `.gitignore`; committed the scaffold.
- Started **Postgres 16 + PostGIS** and **Adminer** via `docker compose up -d`.
- Backend: created `.env` from `.env.example`, ran `npm install`, added the
  missing `xlsx` dependency (the seed script needed it but package.json lacked it).
- Applied the full schema (`backend/src/migrations/001_init.sql`) — 12 tables
  including the PostGIS `location_pings` and `attendance` tables.
- Seeded the agency row **"Rudrayani Fintech"**
  (id `a8bc9b67-6fa0-4e9a-a2d5-230be9042fd5`).
- **Fixed the disposition seed script:** `Trail_Codes.xlsx` has 70 data rows, but
  8 of them carry only remark text — they are extra remark-template variants of
  the `CB` (Call Back) code in the row above. The script previously skipped them
  (seeding 62); it now forward-fills the parent's action/result/description so
  **all 70 rows are preserved**, giving 9 selectable CB variants.

### How to view
- API health: http://localhost:4000/api/health → `{"status":"ok","db_connected":true}`
- Tables & seeded data: Adminer at http://localhost:8080 (credentials in README) —
  check `agencies` (1 row) and `disposition_codes` (70 rows).

## 2026-07-05 — Task 1.1: Backend TypeScript conversion & project hygiene

**Goal:** put the backend on solid footing before building features on it.

### Changes
- **Converted the backend to TypeScript** (strict mode). All `.js` sources replaced
  by `.ts`; dev server now runs via `tsx watch`, production build via `tsc`
  (`npm run build` → `dist/`).
- **App/server split:** `src/app.ts` builds the Express app (testable without
  binding a port); `src/server.ts` boots it.
- **Validated configuration:** `src/config/env.ts` parses all environment
  variables through a zod schema — the app fails fast at startup if anything
  required (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`) is missing.
- **Structured logging:** pino (`src/config/logger.ts`) + pino-http request logs
  (health checks excluded to keep logs readable).
- **Central error handling:** `src/middleware/error-handler.ts` — consistent JSON
  errors, zod validation errors → 400, `HttpError` class for handlers, JSON 404.
- **Versioned migrations:** `node-pg-migrate` adopted. The original
  `src/migrations/001_init.sql` is frozen; its schema now lives as the idempotent
  baseline migration `migrations/1783216000000_baseline-init.sql`. All future
  schema changes: `npm run migrate:create <name>` → `npm run migrate:up`.
- **Lint/format:** ESLint (typescript-eslint, flat config) + Prettier.
- **Tests:** vitest + supertest (`test/health.test.ts`) — health endpoint and
  JSON 404 covered; `npm test` (needs the DB container running).
- Seed & purge scripts ported to TS: `npm run seed:dispositions -- <agency_id>`,
  `npm run purge:pings`.

### How to view
- `cd backend && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` — all green.
- http://localhost:4000/api/health → `{"status":"ok","db_connected":true}`
- http://localhost:4000/api/anything-else → `{"error":"Not found"}` (JSON, from
  the new error pipeline).
- `npm run migrate:up` → "No migrations to run" (baseline already recorded in the
  `pgmigrations` table).
