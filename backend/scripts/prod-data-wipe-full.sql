-- ============================================================
-- PRODUCTION FULL RESET (portable SQL -- no psql-only syntax)
-- Wipes everything except: the agency row, the agency-admin login
-- (phone 9999999999), disposition_codes, and static app config
-- (permissions, capability_permissions, system_field_definitions).
--
-- IMPORTANT: this file intentionally avoids `\gset` and `:'var'`
-- (psql meta-commands / client-side variables) -- a GUI client like
-- Beekeeper Studio does not understand them, silently fails those
-- specific statements, and continues running the rest, which is how
-- a prior run of this script left branches/teams/companies/non-admin
-- users behind uncleaned while the plain TRUNCATEs went through.
-- Every statement below is plain SQL any Postgres client can run.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run start to finish even if some tables are
-- already empty from a previous partial run.
--
-- Run the WHOLE file in one execution (not statement-by-statement),
-- then check the after-counts before doing anything else.
