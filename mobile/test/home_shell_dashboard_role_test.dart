// Phase 12 (role-based dashboards) + Phase 2 (team_leader removed).
// home_shell.dart picks exactly one of the dashboard tabs (Branch Manager /
// Telecaller / Field Executive) based on the signed-in user's capabilities,
// with branch_manager taking precedence over telecaller over field_agent if
// more than one flag is somehow set; agency_admin/operations_manager fall
// back to the branch_manager tab too (agency-wide scope resolves the same
// way server-side). The branching itself is a pure function
// (resolveDashboardRole) precisely so it can be tested here without mounting
// the full HomeShell widget tree -- WorklistScreen (one of the other tabs)
// pulls in Hive/connectivity_plus platform channels that aren't mocked
// anywhere in this test suite, so a full-tree HomeShell widget test isn't
// practical; the per-screen rendering tests (telecaller_dashboard_test.dart
// etc.) cover the new screens themselves in isolation instead.
